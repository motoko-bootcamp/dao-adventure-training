# Day 4️⃣

## 💭 Story

Welcome to Day 4 of the Motoko Bootcamp.
Kudos to you for persevering through the first 3 days - you're a true hero! 🦸

If you think you've missed something, feel free to revisit previous lessons.

Today, our primary focus is on addressing potential challenges when upgrading your canister. This is essential knowledge since you'll be upgrading your canister frequently as you build your application, add new features, and fix bugs.

Keep in mind, if reading and coding is pushing your brain to its limit, take a break. Go for a walk or arrange a game session with your teammates to recharge. Try [Skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/), a free online multiplayer drawing and guessing pictionary game, for some creative fun.
