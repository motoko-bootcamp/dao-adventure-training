# Day 3Ô∏è‚É£

## Introduction

Welcome back for **Day 3!** <br/> 
As we are near the middle of the week, we hope you're all advancing, acquiring new skills, and enjoying the journey.

Today we will talk about two fundamental topics:

- Interacting with other canisters through intercanister calls.
- Handling errors in **Motoko**.

It's vital to master the topics we'll explore today. If you need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to your teammates or mentors. Remember, we're all here to learn, share a laugh, and support one another. üòâ

## Motoko pill  üíä

> Motoko was created by Andreas Rossberg who also co-created WebAssembly. He is the father of Motoko and a real genius that worked at the DFINITY Foundation in the early days. Here is [his official video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eSceDOS-Ms) presentation. Thanks Andreas!
